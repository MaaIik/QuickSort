## QuickSort
## Applied Algorithms course (IKT301) from University 
### Divide and Qonquer Algorithm: *QuickSort*

In this assignment, I will use the Basic World Cities Database. 
It can be downloaded for free from https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities

## Task:
At first, use the unique latitude values of each city only. 
1. Implement a proper quick sort algorithm so that all city latitudes are in an ordered list.
2. Count  the  number  of  comparisons  needed  to  sort  the  dataset.  Does  it  change  if  you randomly order the list before sorting? Why/why not?

Use the latitude and longitude values for each city.

3. Implement a proper quick sort algorithm so that the (latitude, longitude) pairs are in an 
ordered list.
